# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn hardhat help

For unit tests:
yarn hardhat test --network localhost

For staging tests:
yarn hardhat test --network goerli

For local deploy:
yarn hardhat deploy

For deploying on a defined network:
yarn hardhat deploy --network goerli


yarn hardhat node
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
